## Overview

safe-step is a powerful developer toolkit that simplifies camera validation and enhances real-time video analysis for embedded systems and robotics. It integrates hardware diagnostics, environmental awareness, and intelligent object detection into a cohesive framework, enabling autonomous decision-making and system robustness.

**Why safe-step?**

This project aims to streamline camera testing, environmental sensing, and object recognition workflows. The core features include:

*   üõ†Ô∏è **Camera Diagnostics:** Facilitates real-time camera testing to verify hardware functionality and connectivity.
*   üöÄ **Autonomous Awareness:** Combines camera control, servo positioning, and alerts for responsive environmental interaction.
*   üîç **Object Detection:** Implements scalable, real-time object detection and annotation using YOLO.
*   üåê **Distributed Processing:** Supports remote inference and contextual analysis for integrated perception.
*   ‚öôÔ∏è **Modular Architecture:** Designed for seamless integration within complex hardware and software systems.
